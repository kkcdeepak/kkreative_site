        <h1>Quality Assurance And Software Testing</h1>
        <p>
          Software Testing and Quality Assurance are an integral part of the
          software development life-cycle and require as much attention as your
          core software development process.
        </p>
        <p>
          kkreative is of the opinion that software testing is a specialized
          domain, which requires specialized skills and an alternate approach to
          ensure optimal performance of applications and systems being
          developed. Software enterprises need to have efficient and organized
          QA teams and streamlined processes to ensure that newly built software
          applications / systems deliver consistent results.
        </p>
        <p>
